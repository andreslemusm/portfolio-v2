            I went to the{" "}
            <a href="https://unal.edu.co/en.html">
              National University of Colombia
            </a>{" "}
            where I studied <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> with an emphasis
            in Networking (yes, I&apos;m a big fan of the internet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I
            didn&apos;t graduate and probably never will since I already learned
            the topics that would make a difference in my career (OOP, FP, data
            structures, and compilers). Also, today companies don&apos;t require
            you to have a degree, so it isn&apos;t worth investing time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After deciding to focus on learning everything related to front-end
            development (I used{" "}
            <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend">this roadmap</a> to track the
            topics I needed to learn), I spent almost 3 months learning
            everything from HTML up to ReactJS. Finally, I got my first job in
            May 2020 at <a href="https://fluidattacks.com/">Fluid Attacks</a>.
            <p>
              Like everyone, I had difficulties in my learning process:
              <ul>
                <li>Something didn&apos;t click immediately.</li>
                <li>
                  I forgot about something I supposedly learned a week before.
                  üòï
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sometimes it was just that the topic was too difficult to wrap
                  my head around it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              My advice if you&apos;re having the same difficulties is to take{" "}
              <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">
                this course
              </a>{" "}
              (is freemium! ü•≥). It&apos;ll give you powerful tools to improve
              your learning ability.

            I now work as a Frontend Tech Lead for the Ottomoto account at{" "}

            I continue spending a lot of time learning new technologies,
            patterns, libraries, etc. And I&apos;m trying different ways to find
            a balance within that, my current hobbies (CrossFit, videogames, and
            movies) and the ones I&apos;m trying to build (traveling, cooking
            and writing).
